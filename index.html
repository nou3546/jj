                    The excitement of growing up comes from the excitement of newness. <br>
                    “First times” I would call them. <br>
                    Dreams of someday having the freedom to drive a car wherever I wanted, or vacationing without the cumbersome weight of my family. <br>
                    But now, with many drives, and many vacations, the used to be wonder factors have dulled, faded, from their fantastical status I once attributed to them. <br>
                    No longer does my heart pump in excitement one month in advance of a vacation, <br>
                    Nor in the advent of being a two hours drive away from home. <br>
                </p>

                    Even with my hobbies in high school, albeit some I may have been forced into, <br>
                    But as college application season ended, and we moved onto college, <br>
                    I considered my activities to be archived, never to be used again. <br>
                    For me, they had no purpose, no value other than the attempt to please an admissions officer <br>

                    Everything changed when I met you. <br>
                    When I met you, it was like reliving my childhood. <br>
                    Any activity, no matter how mediocre I previously thought it was, was raised to pure ecstasy if it meant that I was going to do it with you. <br>
                    I  believed that I would return home greeted by the dusty piano keys, rather, I play, in hopes of you singing along to the song. <br>
                    Tennis balls which haven’t been used in over a year, was bounced on the court for the first time with you. <br>
                    Activities that I would attribute to mundane: talking walks, cooking food, even rotting in bed, have become so enjoyable when you are by my side. <br>
                    Jayjay, you have breathed new life into me. <br>
                    You’ve made everything feel meaningful again. <br>
                    I desire to do everything with you, from the most tedious tasks to highest highs, I want to do it all.

                    I dream of driving forever, talking while the radio plays. <br>
                    I dream of exploring the world together with you, in any destination, in any part of the word. <br>
                    You have no idea how much I want it. <br>
                    You’ve given me a second life <br>

                    Especially in my two days Europe, jay, I’ve missed you so much. It’s hard with the time zone changes now, that I see you haven’t said a word in a few hours to find out you’re already asleep. Laying in bed for the few hours before I fall asleep knowing I can’t talk to you pains my heart. I miss you so much. I’ve listed things I want to talk to you over FaceTime, but I fear our calls may not be as frequent as I thought. 
                    Even more so jayjay, I want to explore Europe with you so so bad. This place is beautiful, from the architecture, food, weather. I want your narak face walking by my side in these streets. i’m really considering going Europe abroad next spring already.

                    I miss u so much, I love you so much
